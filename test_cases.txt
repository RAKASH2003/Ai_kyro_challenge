*   **Complex Carbohydrates:** Choose complex carbohydrates like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables for sustained energy.
*   **Frequent Meals:** Eat smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day to increase calorie intake without feeling overly full.
*   **Hydration:** Drink plenty of water throughout the day.
*   **Snacks:** Incorporate healthy snacks between meals.

**Sample Diet Plan:**

*   **Breakfast (400-500 calories):** Oatmeal with nuts, seeds, and berries and a source of protein (protein shake, eggs, or Greek yogurt).
*   **Mid-Morning Snack (200-300 calories):** A handful of nuts and a piece of fruit.
*   **Lunch (500-600 calories):** Chicken or fish with a serving of brown rice and mixed vegetables, dressed with olive oil.
*   **Afternoon Snack (200-300 calories):** Greek yogurt with honey and granola.
*   **Dinner (600-700 calories):** Lean beef or lentil stew with a side of quinoa and steamed green vegetables.
*   **Evening Snack (150-250 calories):** A glass of milk or a protein smoothie.

**Foods to Focus On:**

*   **Protein:** Chicken, fish, beef, eggs, dairy products, legumes, tofu.
*   **Healthy Fats:** Avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil.
*   **Complex Carbohydrates:** Whole grains (brown rice, quinoa, oats), fruits, vegetables.
